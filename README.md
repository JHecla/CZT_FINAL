# Raw data
Due to large size of data, raw data is uploaded to google drive to be downloaded
Use "make data" to fetch the raw data. I'm actually trying to move the downloaded h5 file in Downloads into SIS/wrapper. Manually do so if that does not work. Sorry.

# Run the reproducible code
Use "make analysis" to run the three python files. However, raw data should be in '../../SIS/wrapper/DATA_Cs.h5' to be able to run.

# Make the pdf file
Use "make" to generate pdf file
